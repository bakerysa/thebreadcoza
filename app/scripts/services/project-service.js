It is the first of it's kind and holds some of the best gear available to the local market. Situated at 73 Juta st. Braamfontein, Anatomy is a place for sneaker enthusiasts to hang out, shop, and collaborate. </p><p>The store includes an access system developed by The Bread and ThingKing. A visitor enters their mobile number into a tablet at the store, they receive a pin which they then enter into the door to gain access. </p> <p> The Bread saw the project through from concept and design to fabrication, build, launch event, and PR. We transformed a derelict basement of a 60 year-old building into the streetwear store JHB has been waiting for. </p> <p> We invited Heron Preston (of Been Trill NYC) to launch the store with us in an opening that would go down in history. </p>",

In this time we worked with various creative partners to conceptualise the space, produce all the elements, create workshops and ensure the live music offering was something to write home about. The entire Bread team went to Cape Town for a week - 3 Days to build the entire space (in what was nothing more than a glass box 5 stories high at the foot of Table Mountain), and 4 days of running the actual event</p> <p>From custom deck chairs, coffee mugs, and pop corn boxes, to checkered wooden floors, 3m high walls, and a custom-made arcade claw machine filled with VANS merch, we pushed ourselves and our brilliant suppliers to pull off one of our favourite events of the year for one of the best clients one could hope for!</p>",

The event exposed people to the concept behind ProTEST HIV, a movement that hopes to grow its global presence very quickly. They advocate a pro-test lifestyle and focus on ensuring youths know their status by removing the stigma around HIV. All proceeds went to AIDS research.</p>",

We focused heavily on reducing visual clutter, and bringing the colour palette of the store into a neutral range, allowing the massive variety of product to shine. </p><p>Because of the size and shape of the space we split the shop in two: The front space for clothing and accessories, and a "sneaker lounge" in the back. The spaces are divided by powder-coated mesh walls, and the dropped ceiling feature in the sneaker lounge draws intrigue from passersby. </p>',

We transformed it into House Of Vans JHB for 3 days. A dilapidated building with a massive inner-city secret courtyard - never seen by revelers before and never to be used as a venue in the same way again.</p><p>Over 3 days we packed the venue with an incredible mix of artists, musicians, activities, workshops, skate comps, and plenty food and drink. Over 5000 people attended over 3 days in what was the ultimate celebration of Vans and the city of Johannesburg.</p>',
